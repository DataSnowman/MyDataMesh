# MyDataMesh
This is an example of a Data Mesh Architecture deployed using Azure Analytics ARM Accelerators along with use cases to create a Data Product for a given Data Domain.  To deploy additional Data Domains and create additional Data Products use the Deploy to Azure ARM templates to deploy into other Azure Regions or Resource Groups.

## Azure Analytics ARM Accelerators

### Step 1 - Deploy Azure Analytic Services to land, stage, and enrich data

The following accelerator can be used to deploy `Azure Data Factory`, `Azure Databricks`, `Azure Data Lake Storage`, and `Azure SQL Database` into an Azure Resource Group.  It will allow you to explore some of the Data Integration, Data Lake, and Lakehouse Architecture capabilities available on Microsoft Azure.  

### Purpose

The purpose of this Analytics Accelerator is to help you learn and grow through Hands-on common use cases that show you how to use things like ADF pipelines, Databricks notebooks, and SQL scripts.

This [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DataSnowman/MyDataMesh) along with an Azure Subscription [No Azure Subscription click here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) should allow you to accelerate:

* Business Value
* Time-to-insight
* Modernization
* Skilling
* Proof of Concepts
* Architecture choice
* Infrastructure as code for deployment via ARM template

### Prerequisites

- Owner to the Azure Subscription being deployed. This is for creation of a separate Analytics Accelerator Resource Group and to delegate roles necessary for this deployment.

### Deploy Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, ADLS, and Azure SQL Database

`Together with Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and Azure SQL Database`

This template deploys the following:

- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Databricks Workspace
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Azure SQL Database

## Post Deployment Steps

One you have complete the deployment please go to [Next Steps](https://github.com/DataSnowman/MyDataMesh/tree/main/usecases/cdc/steps/usecasesteps.md) to configure and run the Change Data Capture of changes made to the Azure SQL Database which ADF copies and Azure Databricks autoloads.
